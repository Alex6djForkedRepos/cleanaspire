### Overview

**CleanAspire** is a cutting-edge open-source project combining the latest .NET 9 Minimal API with Blazor WebAssembly, all organized with the principles of **Clean Architecture**. This template is built to accelerate the development of scalable and maintainable Progressive Web Applications (PWA) while keeping the codebase neat, modular, and future-proof.


### Features

- **.NET 9 Minimal API** for lightweight, high-performance backend services.
- **Blazor WebAssembly** for a modern, responsive client-side PWA.
- **Clean Architecture** principles to promote separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Minimal Boilerplate** for developers to jump-start their projects without repetitive setup.
- **RESTful APIs** that are efficient and easy to use.
- **Strong Typing** throughout the client and server to leverage the full power of C#.
- **Ready-to-Deploy** template for Azure, AWS, Docker, and other cloud platforms.

### Why CleanAspire?

- **Speed Up Development**: Start coding your features instead of setting up boilerplate code.
- **Modern and Performant**: Benefit from .NET 9's new features and the rich interactivity of Blazor WebAssembly as a PWA.
- **Modular and Testable**: Clean Architecture makes maintaining and testing your project a breeze.
- **Community-driven**: CleanAspire is open-source, encouraging contributions and collaboration from developers worldwide.
